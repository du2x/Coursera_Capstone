Identifying the major social class of a neighborhood can be very worth information, especially for entrepeneurs looking for the best spot for their business. 

Based upon a census, the neighborhoods of Belo Horizonte were ordered and organized into four distinct types or classes: low, regular, high and luxury.

This work was made by "Fundação Instituto de Pesquisas Econômicas Administrativas e Contábeis de Minas Gerais" and it's report can be download here (https://ipead.face.ufmg.br/_site/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Classes_Bairros_BH_com_mapa.pdf)

It's great when someone publishes a report like this, but it's not always the case.
